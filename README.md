# Darevia

I have developed this project as a step in my personal career. I will connect the database when I complete its preparation.

I have developed a truth & dare application that you can play with your friends. You randomly select 2 people from the users in the game room and they are asked questions / tasks by the application and are expected to do them. The score ranking will be presented to you with the points given as a result of the expected result.
